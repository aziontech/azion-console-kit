# How to use this file: 
#
# 1. If your squad is the main responsible for an app, enter it
# here to prevent any changes from being released without your consent. 
#
# 2. This is optional, but once your app is here, it is very  important 
# that your squad pay attention to the sre-swe channel for code review 
# requests to avoid blocking PR from other squads.
#
# 3. The order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. If 2 or more squads are responsible for the same app
# they both can be added in the same line.
