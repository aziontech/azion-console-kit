# Azion Platform Kit

## Introduction

The Azion Platform Kit is a front-end development kit made in Vue/Vite with the PrimeVue and Tailwind framework that allows you to run customized Azion Realtime Manager.

## Getting Started

Letâ€™s test drive it in under 5 minutes.

We suggest using `yarn` and `node 18.*` via the instructions below, but if you don't like running things on your machine you can use docker for this.

```
alias yarn="docker run -it --rm -p 5173:5173 -v $HOME:/root -v $PWD:/usr/src/app -w /usr/src/app node:18 yarn"
```

1. To start, clone the repository and navigate to the root folder.

```cmd
git clone git@github.com:aziontech/azion-platform-kit.git
cd azion-platform-kit
```

2. TEMPORARY - Create a personal token in [Azion Realtime Manager](https://manager.azion.com/iam/personal-tokens) and save it into file `.env.development`

```cmd
echo 'VITE_PERSONAL_TOKEN=azionPERSONALTOKEN' > .env.development
```

3. Start the project using:

```cmd
  $ yarn install
  $ yarn dev --host
```

The webapp is now available on the following URL: http://localhost:5173

## Run at Edge

Azion Platform Kit runs natively on Azion's edge thanks to Azion CLI.

1. Download and configure Azion-CLI with a [Personal Token](https://manager.azion.com/iam/personal-tokens)

```cmd
curl https://downloads.azion.com/linux/x86_64/azioncli -o azioncli && chmod +x azioncli
./azioncli configure -t azionPERSONALTOKEN
```

2. Build the bundler and copy the content from `dist` to `.edge/statics`

```cmd
yarn build
mkdir -p .edge/statics && cp -r ./dist/* .edge/statics
```

3. Publish your edge application

```cmd
azioncli edge_applications publish
```

After a few seconds, you can access your project on the Domain informed by the CLI. This is one example of CLI output

```
$ azioncli edge_applications publish

Note: We are launching a new version of AzionCLI. Stay tuned for a new way to publish your platform kit at Edge.

## Features

The top features include:

1. **Multi-tenancy:** Build your Real Time Manager according to your needs by consuming the endpoints from our Public API: [Azion Public API](https://api.azion.com)
2. **Customizable UI:** configure theme tokens or generate them automatically via [Builder](https://designer.primevue.org/) in your project, giving the look and feel according to your needs.
3. **Simple structure:** layered separation of blocks, components and services so that it is easy to build a new route in a very short time.
